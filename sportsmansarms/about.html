                    The Sportsmans Arms went through a huge refurbishment in 2018, which relocated the bar and installed new carpets making the pub feel more homely and less like your traditional pub. new chairs and a new booth was added along with a new 50" TV with surround sound for the best experience for the live sports.

                <p id="aboutP3" class="aboutP">
                    Rumour has it that the sportsmans arm is haunted by a friendly ghost that likes to play tricks on the locals. there have been reports that the ghost, which the locals refer to as George, likes to move keys and occasionally knock a glass off the edge of the bar. He also likes to play pool, as some have heard the pool balls clash together when no-one was near the pool table.
